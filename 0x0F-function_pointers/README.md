	-> op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);
	-> op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);
	-> op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);
	-> op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);
	-> op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);

=> 3-get_op_func.c: This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. Youâ€™re not allowed to declare any other function.
